# DecisionTreeCoursework
Implement a decision tree algorithm and use it to determine one of the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone.


Grading scheme
Final Grade = Report content + Code quality + Report quality
• Code (total : 20)
– Results on secret test dataset: 10
Make sure that your code runs. If not, you will lose most of the code mark
– Presentation of the code (comments, indentation, structure): 5
– README instructions: 5
• Report content (total : 70)
– Output of the tree visualisation function: BONUS 5 – Step 3 - Evaluation
∗ Cross validation classification metrics (total 15) · Confusion matrix: 10
· The accuracy: 1
· The recall and precision per class: 2
· The F1-measures: 2
∗ Result analysis (5 lines max): 10
∗ Dataset differences (5 lines max): 10
– Step 4 - Pruning (and evaluation again)
∗ Cross validation classification metrics after pruning (total 15)
· Confusion matrix: 10
· The accuracy: 1
· The recall and precision per class: 2 · The F1-measures: 2
∗ Result analysis after pruning (5 lines max): 10 ∗ Depth analysis (5 lines max): 10
• Report quality (total : 10)
– Quality of presentation: 10
